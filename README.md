# 🔁 Nonlinear Dynamical System: Fixed Point Analysis

This project explores a two-variable nonlinear system using numerical simulation and stability analysis. The system is defined by coupled difference equations and analyzed for fixed points and stability through Jacobian eigenvalue computation.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Identify and classify fixed points of the nonlinear system
- Derive and analyze the Jacobian matrix
- Simulate the system and visualize vector fields
- Evaluate system stability using symbolic and numeric eigenvalue methods

## 🔍 Key Concepts
- Fixed Point & Stability
- Eigenvalue Analysis
- Nonlinear Systems
- Vector Field Visualization
